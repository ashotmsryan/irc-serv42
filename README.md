# irc-serv42
It is my version of IRC-Server for reference client of KVIrc</br>
WORKS ON INTEL BASED MAC!!!!</br> 
<h3>Key aspects of the IRC server project include:</h3>

<pre>
1)Learning Objectives: The project aims to understand networking concepts, client-server architecture,
  and real-time communication protocols.</br>
2)Technical Challenges: I face technical challenges in developing a robust
  and scalable server application that can handle multiple client connections,
  manage user authentication, and support various IRC commands and functionalities.</br>
3)Software Development Skills: The project encourages me to apply my programming skills in languages such
  as C, C++, Python, or other languages suitable for server-side development. 
  I gain experience in socket programming, concurrency, and error handling.
4)Not supporting server to server communication.</pre>

<h3>How to use</h3>
